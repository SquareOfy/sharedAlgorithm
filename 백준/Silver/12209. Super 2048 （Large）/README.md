### 문제 설명

<p>2048 is a famous single-player game in which the objective is to slide tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.</p>

<p>2048 is played on a simple 4 x 4 grid with tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them. For each movement, the player can choose to move all tiles in 4 directions, left, right, up, and down, as far as possible at the same time. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. <strong>In one movement, one newly created tile can not be merged again and always is merged with the tile next to it along the moving direction first.</strong> E.g. if the three "2" are in a row "2 2 2" and the player choose to move left, it will become "4 2 0", the most left 2 "2" are merged.</p>

<p>The above figure shows how 4 x 4 grid varies when player moves all tiles 'right'.</p>

<p>Alice and Bob accidentally find this game and love the feel when two tiles are merged. After a few round, they start to be bored about the size of the board and decide to extend the size of board to <strong>N</strong> x <strong>N</strong>, which they called the game "Super 2048".</p>

<p>The big board then makes them dazzled (no zuo no die -_-| ). They ask you to write a program to help them figure out what the board will be looked like after all tiles move to one specific direction on a given board.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, <strong>T</strong>. <strong>T</strong> test cases follow. The first line of each test case gives the side length of the board, <strong>N</strong>, and the direction the tiles will move to, <strong>DIR</strong>. <strong>N</strong> and <strong>DIR</strong> are separated by a single space. <strong>DIR</strong> will be one of four strings: "left", "right", "up", or "down".</p>

<p>The next <strong>N</strong> lines each contain <strong>N</strong> space-separated integers describing the original state of the board. Each line represents a row of the board (from top to bottom); each integer represents the value of a tile (or 0 if there is no number at that position).</p>

<p>Limits</p>

<ul>
	<li>Each number in the grid is either 0 or a power of two between 2 and 1024, inclusive.</li>
	<li><span style="line-height:1.6em">1 ≤ </span><strong style="line-height:1.6em">T</strong><span style="line-height:1.6em"> ≤ 100 </span></li>
	<li>1 ≤ <strong>N</strong> ≤ 20 </li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x:", where x is the test case number (starting from 1). Then output <strong>N</strong> more lines, each containing <strong>N</strong> space-separated integers which describe the board after the move in the same format as the input.</p>
